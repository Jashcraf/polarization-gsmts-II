Repository for the data analysis tools used in the paper "Polarization Aberrations in the GSMTs II: Influence of segment-to-segment variations on high-contrast imaging and polarimetry". This repo contains a simulator script `gsmts.py` which calls [Poke](https://github.com/Jashcraf/poke) and [HCIPy](https://github.com/ehpor/hcipy) to simulate the polarization aberrations and propagate them through a coronagraph model.

This is a follow up to our previous paper [Anche et al 2023](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/04/aa45651-22/aa45651-22.html)

Paper I
- Optical design perscription ✔️
- Summary of ray tracing ✔️
- Comparison of coating, reflection coeffs, diattenuation, retardance ✔️
- Jones pupil comparison ✔️
- Coronagraph with perfect coronagraph and contrast limits ✔️

Paper II
- Segment Errors: Missing segments, misalignments, psf polarization
- Coating non-uniformity on segments
- Impact on polarimetry of stars and debris disks
